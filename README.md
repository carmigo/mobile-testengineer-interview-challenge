## iOS
The iOS project can be found in the `TestEngineerChallenge-iOS` directory. This challenge will test your ability to write unit and UI tests, and identify bugs and quality control issues.

#### Setup
1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
1. Clone the forked repository to your development machine.
1. Complete the assigned [Tasks](#tasks) below, within the time limit given to you.
1. Commit your work to your repository, and push these changes to your remote repository.
1. Make your repository public or provide access to the interviewers' GitHub account.
1. Notify the interviewers when the project is ready for review.
1. UI tests run in the simulator will fail to send keyboard events when the menu option `I/O > Keyboard > Connect Hardware Keyboard` is enabled. Make sure it is disabled. Alternatively, resetting the simulator (`Device > Erase All Content and Settings...`) will also return it to a good state that lasts until you next interact with the simulator keyboard.

#### Tasks
1. Write UI tests for the app with the level of coverage you feel is appropriate for a typical app.
1. Write unit tests for the `Authenticator` struct that cover all input scenarios.
1. Edit this `README.md` file, filling in the [Answers](#answers) section below.
1. **BONUS**: Set up the tests to run with a free CI service such as GitHub Actions.
